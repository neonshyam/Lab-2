## Exercises

### Exercise 1

```{r}
the_tate
```

```{r}
dplyr::summarize(the_tate.data)
```

The `the_tate` dataset has \_\_\_ unique artists who worked from \_\_\_ to \_\_\_. The works were acquired between the years \_\_\_ and \_\_\_.

### Exercise 2

How number of works with missing dates is \_\_.

The number of artists whose works have missing dates is \_\_.

It would require resolving missing year data for only \_\_ artists resolve resolve at least 50% of the missing data.

The missing year data likely to be classified as \_\_\_\_.

### Exercise 3

The artist with the most works in the Tate collection is \_\_\_.

The artist with the tenth-most works in the Tate collection is \_\_\_.

### Exercise 4

The artist with the greatest number of works in the Tate collection represent \_\_\_% of the total number of works

### Exercise 5

There are \_\_ duplicate artist-title pairs

### Exercise 6

The artist with the largest work in the tate collection is \_\_\_

The artist with the smallest work in the collection is \_\_\_. The smallest work has area \_\_\_ $\text{cm}^2$

### Exercise 7

...

### Exercise 8

The annual return in the SPX price in 2020 was \_\_\_%.

The corresponding price volatility was \_\_\_%.

### Exercise 9
